This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser. (The reqs said they wanted it to run on port 3001, you can change that in the package.json folder if you like).

The virtual gorilla in the room is that I wasn't able to get my local graphql instance running, so I omitted my server side code alltogether. With multiple interviewers requesting that I write sizeable applications for consideration, I just ran out of time.  I built out the requested functionality with a hard-coded array in App.js starting on line 14. During our phone call Chris and I discussed that no class based components were being used, so I wrote my code using functions and utilized hooks. I broke out the natural functionality into their own components I commented where appropriate. 

I got started with some styling using semantic-ui React, but when I soon realized that my local graphql code wasn't up to par I eliminated anything that would inadvertently eat up time, hence a very, very vanilla css palette. I've got some nicer design stuff over at cfsnap.com/

Let me know if you have any questions or would like me to share thoughts/reasons for building this the way I did.
